> The shoppies is a responsive web app built on React.js focused on helping users search and dynamically nominate movies.

> Feautures
>- You can select from thousands of movies from the [OMDB API](omdbapi.com/).
>- Interactive design, inspired by the [Shopify's Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/) design system. 
>- The app suggests some movies first if you don't know which movie to pick first. 
>- You can look for a movie on IMDB before selecting it.
>- Pure CSS, making it completely customizable.
>- All the data is saved on the local memory, making it accessible on the browser at any time.

>There was a process of design using paper sketching and rapid prototyping. In the end, [Sketch with the Polaris components](https://polaris.shopify.com/resources/polaris-ui-kit) was the tool that helped the decision of the font, colors  and general layout of the site.
